I am Shervin Khalafi, a second-year PhD student of [Electrical & Systems Engineeering](https://www.ese.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). I am advised by [Prof. Alejandro Ribeiro](https://alelab.seas.upenn.edu/alejandro-ribeiro/). My research inteterests include Generative Models, Optimization Theory, and graph-based Machine Learning.

In particular, I am currently developing constrained optimization frameworks for training generative models (diffusion models in particular) under requirements. I am also exploring
how to design diffusion processes that are best-suited to generating graphs.
